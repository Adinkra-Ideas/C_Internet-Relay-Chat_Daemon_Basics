# piscine_rush-00
The following were the codes I wrote as my contribution to my Rush group during the 2021 42Wolfsburg Autumn Piscine. Although the codes passed the Rush 00 evaluation, it looks really funny to me now because I wrote it while I was only 2 weeks into learning C language at the time. This was the first mini program I built using C :)
