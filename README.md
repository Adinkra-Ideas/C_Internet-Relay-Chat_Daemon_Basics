# piscine_rush-00
The following were the codes I wrote as my contribution to my Rush group during the 2021 42Wolfsburg Autumn Piscine. Although the codes passed the Rush 00 evaluation, it looks really funny to me now because I wrote it while I was only 2 weeks into learning C language at the time. This was the first mini program I built using C :)
For those who dont know what this code is all about, it is a basic practice / learning project for beginners to C language where one has to write a function that displays a box whose size (height and width) can be adjusted dynamically by simply sending the desired height and width as int args to the function. But we aren't allowed to use functions from any of the standard libraries besides Malloc and Free
